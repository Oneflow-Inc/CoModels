## EfficientNet 
EfficientNet is an efficient neural network architecture that achieves outstanding performance with relatively fewer parameters and computational costs by combining specific components and techniques in deep learning. The design of EfficientNet is based on the concept of Compound Scaling, which simultaneously adjusts the network's width, depth, and resolution across different dimensions to achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency. This enables EfficientNet to excel in various scenarios with limited computational resources, such as mobile devices and embedded systems, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The emergence of EfficientNet has greatly advanced the efficient deployment and application of deep learning models, making it a significant breakthrough in the field.
### Installation
- Install the latest version of OneFlow
```bash
python3 -m pip install oneflow -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/master/[PLATFORM]
```
Find more information on [install oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow#install-oneflow)

- Install flowvision

Then install the latest stable release of flowvision

```bash
pip install flowvision==0.2.1
```

- Install other requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
#### ImageNet
For ImageNet dataset, you can download it from http://image-net.org/. We provide the following two ways to load data:

- For standard folder dataset, move validation images to labeled sub-folders. The file structure should look like:
  ```bash
  $ tree data
  imagenet
  ├── train
  │   ├── class1
  │   │   ├── img1.jpeg
  │   │   ├── img2.jpeg
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── class2
  │   │   ├── img3.jpeg
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  └── val
      ├── class1
      │   ├── img4.jpeg
      │   ├── img5.jpeg
      │   └── ...
      ├── class2
      │   ├── img6.jpeg
      │   └── ...
      └── ...


### Training

You can use bash script `train.sh` to train this model.

```bash
sh train.sh
```

### inference

Bash script `infer.sh` is used to infer the trained model.

```bash
sh infer.sh
```
