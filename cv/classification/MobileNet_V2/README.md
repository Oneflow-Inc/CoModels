## MobileNet
MobileNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is optimized for mobile devices and embedded vision applications. Introduced by Google researchers in 2017, MobileNet primarily uses lightweight depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the model size and computational complexity, enabling efficient image recognition tasks in environments with limited computational resources.

Depthwise separable convolution, the core technology of MobileNet, decomposes traditional convolution operations into depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. Depthwise convolution is responsible for extracting spatial features from images, while pointwise convolution combines these features into a higher-level feature representation. This approach significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations in the model, while maintaining good model performance.

### Installation
- Install the latest version of OneFlow
```bash
python3 -m pip install oneflow -f https://staging.oneflow.info/branch/master/[PLATFORM]
```
Find more information on [install oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow#install-oneflow)

- Install flowvision

Then install the latest stable release of flowvision

```bash
pip install flowvision==0.2.1
```

- Install other requirements
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
#### ImageNet
For ImageNet dataset, you can download it from http://image-net.org/. We provide the following two ways to load data:

- For standard folder dataset, move validation images to labeled sub-folders. The file structure should look like:
  ```bash
  $ tree data
  imagenet
  ├── train
  │   ├── class1
  │   │   ├── img1.jpeg
  │   │   ├── img2.jpeg
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── class2
  │   │   ├── img3.jpeg
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  └── val
      ├── class1
      │   ├── img4.jpeg
      │   ├── img5.jpeg
      │   └── ...
      ├── class2
      │   ├── img6.jpeg
      │   └── ...
      └── ...


### Training

You can use bash script `train.sh` to train this model.

```bash
sh train.sh
```

### inference

Bash script `infer.sh` is used to infer the trained model.

```bash
sh infer.sh
```
